## Inbound / Arrival Clearances

On contact with the first FACA unit (FACA_W) or (FACA_E), the controller will be the one to issue the arrival clearance into Cape Town. Controllers are to check the latest NOTAMs, aswell as the Cape Town TMA page to keep up to date with the latest STARs in use.

!!! note 
    These STARs are also applicable for aircraft flying into Ysterplaat (FAYP)

When giving the arrival clearance, the aircraft should first be cleared inbound into the sector at their current level, before being passed a STAR, landing runway, and ATIS code in range.

!!! info "STAR Clearance Phraseology"
    "(callsign), cleared inbound FL(flight level), (STAR) arrival landing (runway), check ATIS (code) in range."

e.g.

SAA369, cleared inbound FL340, ERDAS1C arrival landing Runway 01, check ATIS B in range.

Should the aircraft either:
* Already have received its STAR clearance for FACT/FAYP from another ATS unit
* Overflying FACA or your sector in general

then the controller should only clear the aircraft at their level.

!!! info "Inbound Phraseology"
    "(callsign), cleared inbound FL(flight level)."

e.g.

SAA369, cleared inbound FL340.

The pilot should read back their cleared level as confirmation.
